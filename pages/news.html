<h2>Joel Embiid's First Career Triple Double</h2>

<p id="Embiid">
    Embiid scored 19 points (6-20 FG, 4-7 3Pt, 3-4 FT) while adding 13 rebounds, 
    10 assists and two blocks in 36 minutes during Wednesday's 111-106 loss to the Magic.
    Playing alongside the newly acquired Jimmy Butler for the first time, Embiid didn't have 
    his most efficient offensive performance but still recorded the first triple-double of his career. 
    He's already averaging a career-high 3.9 assists per game so far this season, but with Butler now in 
    the fold to draw defensive attention, and J.J. Redick apparently remaining in the starting five to help 
    spread the floor for the Sixers, Embiid's distribution numbers could continue to rise.

     Los Angeles Lakers guard Rajon Rondo will miss "a few weeks" with a broken right hand, 
     coach Luke Walton announced on Wednesday night.
     Rondo suffered the injury during the Lakers' 126-117 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. 
     Rondo finished the game with three assists, two rebounds and two steals in 15 minutes.

<p id="LBJ">
     LeBron James hit another career milestone on Wednesday night as he passed Wilt Chamberlain 
     for fifth on the NBA's all-time scoring list. James reached 31,420 career points with an
     and-one free throw in the fourth quarter to pass Chamberlain. James, 33, now sits directly behind
     Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA's all-time scoring list.
